title: Shapeshifter
girl:
  name: Kira
  species: Changeling
boy:
  name: Charlie
  species: Human
plot: |
  - {{g.name}} has a crush on {{b.name}}
  - she keeps killing girls he likes
    - so she can shapeshift into them
      - to look like his "type"
        - each form is never good enough
notes: |
  - A {{g.species}} must kill a {{b.species}} to copy their form
    - The {{g.species}} absorbs the victim, leaving no evidence
    - {{g.species}}s are _psychologically incapable_ of feeling remorse for their victims
