        - Flirted
        - __Fell in love__

    - Turns out, she's _super_ rich
        - She's so rich that a restaurant, reserved exclusively for _The 1% Of The Elite_, always has a table reserved for her
- But there's a small problem. she's almost _definitely_ a Pred

            - But she seemed so nice
            - And she seemed to _really_ like him
            - _And_ she seemed excited about the date they'd<sup>[1]</sup> planned
                - <sup>[1]</sup>_She_ planned; she was too giddy and excited to let him get more than a couple words in. it was cute at the time. before he thought she could __eat him__
            - _She wouldn't eat him, right?_
                - He can't ask her.
                    - If she's _not_ a Pred, they'll laugh it off and forget about it
                    - If she _is_ a Pred, she might eat him on the spot
                        - Other people __cannot__ know she's a Pred

Notes

### Preds
- Swallow humans whole
- Complete digestion in < 1 hour
- Psychologically incapable of being empathetic of Prey
    - They are completely incapable of seeing Prey as people. they are nothing but _meat_
    - Feeling someone melt is _entertaining_
- Identical to Humans, except:
    - Gold eyes
    - Naturally:
        - Stronger
        - More attractive
        - Smarter
        - Faster
    - Skin is a slight __Bronze__ / __Tan__ colour
- The average Pred in Late Primary School / Early Middle School is equivalent to a Human Linebacker in Early High School
