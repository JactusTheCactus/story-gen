"Power"
=======

Characters
----------
- Lia
	- Human

Plot
----
- Lia is the Human bard of an adventuring party
- She always avoids fighting
	- Her party assumes this is because she is scared of getting hurt
		- The _real_ reason is that Lia is worried about collateral damage
			- Ã€ la the __Pistol Shrimp__ scene of "Project Power"
- When Lia uses her power:
	- Eyes turn gold
		- The _metal_, not the _colour_
	- A whisper shakes the earth
	- The movement of her jaw during speach causes shockwaves
	- Speed almost looks like teleportation
		- Each step causes a _thundercrack_

Notes
-----
- Inspired by "Project Power" (2020)
