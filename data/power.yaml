title: Power
girl:
  name: Lia
  species: Human
plot: |
  - {{g.name}} is the {{g.species}} bard of an adventuring party
  - she always avoids fighting
    - her party assumes this is because she is scared of getting hurt
      - the _real_ reason is that {{g.name}} is worried about collateral damage
        - Ã  la the __Pistol Shrimp__ scene of "Project Power"
  - when {{g.name}} uses her power:
    - eyes turn gold
      - the _metal_,
        not the _colour_
    - speed almost looks like teleportation
      - each step causes a _thundercrack_
notes: |
  - shortly prior to the start of the story,
    the party entered a defiled church
    - {{g.name}} seemed reluctant to enter
      - _odd_
