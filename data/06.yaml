  - {{g.name}} just swallowed you whole
  - she's teasing you and mocking you
  - you're not even a person to her; __just a meal__
  - you beg and plead for her to show even an ounce of mercy, but she just laughs
  - after nearly _10 minutes_ of pleading, you accept you fate and start to cry
  - she seems __Amused__

  - you give up and start to lament

  > __{{g.name}}__

  > ...you were going to _what_?
  - you don't hear {{g.name}}'s response of confusion

  - until now, you weren't even _worthy_ of being a person to {{g.name}}
  - but now?
  - _now_ she was actually curious about how you felt about her
    - if you were just another horny boy trying to fuck her,
      - she'd just stop listening and continue digesting you
    - but, if she thought you were worth it,
      - she _might_ consider __not__ digesting you and even letting you out
    - you don't know any of this. she just says;
    > __{{g.name}}__
    >
    > and what if i _did_, hm?~\
    > what would you do to me?~
    - though she tries not to show it, {{g.name}} is actually _very_ excited that you might say something to make you "date material," in her eyes
