  - {{g.name}} is {{b.name}}'s "Best Friend"
  - {{g.name}} was a small,
    petite girl
    - absolutely adorable
  - {{g.name}} just returned from college
  - _Apparently_,
    {{g.name}} discovered she's a {{g.species}}
  - Now,
    {{g.name}}:
    - is taller
      - just by a few inches
        - almost as tall as {{b.name}}
          previously,
            he towered over her
    - is more apathetic
      - but not to {{b.name}},
        who she still considers her "Best Friend"
    - is a {{g.species}}
    - eats people
      - swallows them whole
        - {{g.name}} is scarily efficient with swallowing and digesting people
    - __Scares {{b.name}}__
      - he keeps his distance from her
  - it takes a week for her to notice something's wrong
    - it takes her a few minutes for her to realize _how wrong_
  - her best friend is __Afraid of Her__
    - {{g.name}} has to take several minutes to process
  - as it would turn out,
    {{g.name}} had a crush on {{b.name}} when she left for college
    - in 4 years,
      her feelings haven't changed
      - she would consistently daydream with flushed cheeks of her lips touching {{b.name}}'s
      - but now {{b.name}} is __scared__ of {{g.name}}
  - she showed up at his front door
    > You're scared of me...

    {{g.name}} secretly hoped she was wrong.

    > You're...
    > __scared__ of me...

    her legs were shaky.
    {{g.name}} was on the verge of tears.

    {{g.name}} is in love with {{b.name}}.
    And he _can't_ feel safe with her.
    
    __Can't.__
  - {{g.name}} felt like her entire world was crumbling around her
  - the one certainty in her life,
    that {{b.name}} would always be there to tell her that evrything's okay,
    is gone
    - the love of her life is __terrified__ of her
  - {{g.name}} couldn't keep herself upright
    - she collapsed into his arms,
      crying
