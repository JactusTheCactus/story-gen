Plot
----
- {{ g.name }} considers herself to be {{ b.name }}'s __Best Friend__
- {{ g.name }} invites {{ b.name }} over to her place for the night
    - No sexual pretenses whatsoever
        - There is nothing sexual or romantic about their relationship
            - Purely platonic
- Once {{ b.name }} arrives, {{ g.name }} is ready with snacks, drinks, and really crappy movies that were __not__ worth what she rented them for
### ~1 Hour In
- {{ g.name }}'s tummy rumbles
- She looks at {{ b.name }}
    > "Wouldn't you look sooo cute in my tummy?"
- She keeps joking about eating him
    - There is never any intention to __actually__ eat him
        - Even if she _did_, {{ g.name }} would let him out long before he even __started__ to digest
- {{ b.name }} gets uncomfortable, but she doesn't notice
- When {{ g.name }} opens her mouth and leans in (jokingly, of course)
    - {{ b.name }} leaves, starting to fear that she just sees him as food
        - {{ g.name }} _is_ a {{ g.species }}, afterall
            - Plus, she doesn't really attempt to hide it when she sees a cute boy she wants to eat
                - {{ g.name }} teases {{ b.name }} all throughout her digestion of said "cute boy"
                    - She likes the way {{ b.name }} squirms uncomfortably while her gut turns someone like him into soup
                        - All in good fun _(but not for whatever unfortunate boy_ {{ g.name }} _ate)_
### The Next Day
- After avoiding her all day, {{ g.name }} corners {{ b.name }} in the school hallway, trying to figure out why he left
    - _she_ thought they were having __Fun__
    - _he_ __genuinely__ thought his "Best Friend" was going to __kill him__
        - {{ b.name }} was fearing for his life
        - He thought he was going to die
- When she finds out why he left, {{ g.name }} starts to __cry__
    - She couldnâ€™t even look {{ b.name }} in the eye
        - The thought of her "Best Friend" even _thinking_ she might hurt him broke her

Notes
-----
- {{ g.name }} is _super_ __Gay__
