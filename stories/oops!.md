- ASHLEY
    - PRED
- TEDDY
    - HUMAN

Plot
----
- Ashley considers herself to be Teddy's __Best Friend__
- Ashley invites Teddy over to her place for the night
        - No sexual pretenses whatsoever
                - There is nothing sexual or romantic about their relationship
                        - Purely platonic
- Once Teddy arrives, Ashley is ready with snacks, drinks, and really crappy movies that were __not__ worth what she rented them for
### ~1 Hour In
- Ashley's tummy rumbles
- She looks at Teddy
        > "Wouldn't you look sooo cute in my tummy?"
- She keeps joking about eating him
        - There is never any intention to __actually__ eat him
                - Even if she _did_, Ashley would let him out long before he even __started__ to digest
- Teddy gets uncomfortable, but she doesn't notice
- When Ashley opens her mouth and leans in (jokingly, of course)
        - Teddy leaves, starting to fear that she just sees him as food
                - Ashley _is_ a Pred, afterall
                        - Plus, she doesn't really attempt to hide it when she sees a cute boy she wants to eat
                                - Ashley teases Teddy all throughout her digestion of said "cute boy"
                                        - She likes the way Teddy squirms uncomfortably while her gut turns someone like him into soup
                                                - All in good fun _(but not for whatever unfortunate boy_ Ashley _ate)_
### The Next Day
- After avoiding her all day, Ashley corners Teddy in the school hallway, trying to figure out why he left
        - _She_ thought they were having __Fun__
        - _He_ __genuinely__ thought his "Best Friend" was going to __kill him__
                - Teddy was fearing for his life
                - He thought he was going to die
- When she finds out why he left, Ashley starts to __cry__
        - She couldnâ€™t even look Teddy in the eye
                - The thought of her "Best Friend" even _thinking_ she might hurt him broke her

Notes
-----
- Ashley is _super_ __Gay__
