=======

	- HUMAN

Plot
----
- Lia is the Human bard of an adventuring party
- She always avoids fighting
	- Her party assumes this is because she is scared of getting hurt

			- Ã€ La the __Pistol Shrimp__ scene of "Project Power"
- When Lia uses her power:

		- The _metal_,
			not the _colour_
	- Sinks several inches into the ground,
		due to her _exponentiated mass_
	- Speed almost looks like teleportation
		- Each step causes a _thundercrack_

Notes
-----

	the party entered a defiled church
	- Lia seemed reluctant to enter
		- _Odd_
	- Due to it being a _defiled_ church,
		Lia felt safe entering
		- __Very odd__
- This is a known ability in this world
	- It is of _deific_ rarity
