plot: |
  - {{b.name}} is at a club
  - over the last couple hours,
    - he met a beautiful girl
      - she looks like a _goddess_
    - they:
      - danced
      - drank
      - flirted
      - __fell in love__
  - her name is {{g.name}}
  - she's now fallen asleep in his lap, still in the club
  - next week, she's taking him to an expensive restaurant (turns out, she's __loaded__)
  - but there's a small problem. she's almost _definitely_ a {{g.species}}
    - actually, that's a _huge_ problem
      - a dealbreaker
        - but she seemed so nice
        - and she seemed to _really_ like him
        - _and_ she seemed excited about the date they'd planned (_she_ planned; she was too giddy and excited to let him get more than a couple words in. it was cute at the time. before he thought she could eat him)
        - _she wouldn't eat him, right?_
