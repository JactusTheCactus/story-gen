  ### _MORNING_
  {{ g.name }} woke up bright and early, _actually_ __excited__ about asking {{ b.name }} out on a date.
  (she didn’t get much sleep, because she couldn’t stop herself from planning out the date she would take him on the next day)

  but, when {{ g.name }} woke up and looked at her belly, it was a little softer, a little rounder.
  {{ b.name }} _might've_ survived, sure.
  But {{ g.name }}'s hopes weren't high.

  __Nor were her spirits__

  > You still alive in there?

  > Aww...
  > Guess not...
  >
  > Shame...
  > He'd've made a pretty good boyfriend...
  > A _cute_ one too...
  >
  > __Stupid__ _metabolism_...

  > D-Dead...?

  > {{ b.name }}!
  > You're okay!!

  > __Perfect!__

  > I can't exactly date _buttfat_~

  {{ b.name }} was clearly too weak to move, but still alive.
  {{ g.name }} was going to have to get him out on her own -- not like she was ever going to _struggle_ with that.
