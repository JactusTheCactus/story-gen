"Her Majesty"
=============

Characters
----------
- Tess
	- Pred
- Alex
	- Human

Plot
----
- Alex has somehow found himself at a party held by __The Royal Family__
- Obviously, he's been keeping his distance from the _important_ people;
  - Barons, baronesses, dukes, duchess, etc.
  - _especially_ the __Royals__ (__Big__ _No-No_)
- Alex has, however, made a friend at this party, by the name of Tess
- She's a _small_, _beautiful_ girl, and a _lovely_ dancer
- Better yet, she seems completely enamoured with him
### Later That Night
- Tess gets _too comfortable_ with Alex and accidentally let's slip who she _really_ is; __The Princess__
- She can tell by his expression that he's going to run
  - She has a bad track record for having her boyfriends __not__ get eaten by her or her mother

Notes
-----
- Tess's _mother_ is the __Queen of the Kingdom__
  - __The Queen__ is a very dangerous and vengeful Pred _(public information)_
    - Most of Tess's potential suitors have been a meal for __The Queen__
- Alex is low-middle class
- Tess is kept from the public eye, hence why Alex didn't recognize her as __The Princess__
