    Mera discovered she's a Pred
- Now,
    Mera:
    - Is taller
        - Just by a few inches
            - Almost as tall as Dani
                Previously,
                    He towered over her
    - Is more apathetic
        - But not to Dani,
            Who she still considers her "Best Friend"
    - Is a Pred
    - Eats people
        - Swallows them whole
            - Mera is scarily efficient with swallowing and digesting people
    - __Scares Dani__
        - He keeps his distance from her
- It takes a week for her to notice something's wrong
    - It takes her a few minutes for her to realize _how wrong_
- Her best friend is __Afraid of Her__
    - Mera has to take several minutes to process
- As it would turn out,
    Mera had a crush on Dani when she left for college
    - In 4 years,
        Her feelings haven't changed
        - She would consistently daydream with flushed cheeks of her lips touching Dani's
        - But now Dani is __scared__ of Mera
- She showed up at his front door
    > You're scared of me...

    Mera secretly hoped she was wrong.

    > You're...
    __Scared__ of me...

    Her legs were shaky.
    Mera was on the verge of tears.

    Mera is in love with Dani.
    And he _can't_ feel safe with her.
    
    __Can't.__
- Mera felt like her entire world was crumbling around her
    - The one certainty in her life,
        That Dani would always be there to tell her that everything's okay,
        Is gone
        - The love of her life is __terrified__ of her
- Mera couldn't keep herself upright
    - She collapsed into his arms,
        Crying
- Mera begged Dani to "give [her] a chance"
    - She looked like that tiny girl that left 4 years ago
