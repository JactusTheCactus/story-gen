			- But she seemed so nice
			- And she seemed to _really_ like him
			- _And_ she seemed excited about the date they'd<sup>[1]</sup> planned
				- <sup>[1]</sup>_She_ planned; she was too giddy and excited to let him get more than a couple words in. it was cute at the time. before he thought she could __eat him__
			- _She wouldn't eat him, right?_
				- He can't ask her.
					- If she's _not_ a Pred, they'll laugh it off and forget about it
					- If she _is_ a Pred, she might eat him on the spot
						- Other people __cannot__ know she's a Pred
							- No matter what she thinks, her nature is something that __must__ stay _secret_
- When she wakes up, Felix is gone
- Luckily, they exchanged numbers early on
	> Hey, Felix, where'd you go?
	>
	> Was I too much for you, hm?~

	_She responds in the smallest, softest voice he's ever heard_

	> W-what...?
	>
	> No, I-...
	>
	> O-of course, I'm not-...!

	_Alice is now panicking. if he knows she's a Pred, then he __definitely__ won't want to go out to dinner with her. the thought of __protecting her secret__ doesn't even occur to her._

Notes
-----
### Preds
- Swallow humans whole
- Complete digestion in < 1 hour
- Psychologically incapable of being empathetic of Prey
- Identical to Humans, except:
	- Gold eyes
	- Naturally:
		- Stronger
		- More attractive
		- Smarter
		- Faster
	- Skin is a slight __Bronze__ / __Tan__ colour
- The average Pred in Late Primary School / Early Middle School is equivalent to a Human Linebacker in Early High School
	```Js
	const pred = {
		species: "Pred",
		school: [
			"Late Primary",
			"Early Middle"
		],
		extra: null
	};
	const human = {
		species: "Human",
		school: [
			"Early High"
		],
		extra: "Linebacker"
	};
	console.log(pred === human) // true
	```
