Plot
----
- Delilah just swallowed you whole
- She's teasing you and mocking you
- You're not even a person to her; __just a meal__
- You beg and plead for her to show even an ounce of mercy, but she just laughs
- After nearly _10 minutes_ of pleading, you accept you fate and start to cry
- She seems __Amused__
> __Delilah__
>
> Oh, finally giving up, hm?\~\
> Took you long enough\~
- You give up and start to lament
> __Sam__
>
> And I was even going to _ask you out_ sometime in the next few days...

> __Delilah__
>
> ...You were going to _what_?
- You don't hear Delilah's response of confusion
> __Sam__
>
> I'm an idiot...\
> Like you'd ever want _me_...
- Until now, you weren't even _worthy_ of being a person to Delilah
- But now?
- _Now_ she was actually curious about how you felt about her
    - If you were just another horny boy trying to fuck her,
        - She'd just stop listening and continue digesting you
    - But, if she thought you were worth it,
        - She _might_ consider __not__ digesting you and even letting you out
    - You don't know any of this. she just says;
    > __Delilah__

    > And what if I _did_, hm?\~\
    > What would you do to me?\~
