  - {{b.name}} is minding her own business, when she is suddenly picked up and lifted into the air
  - she looks, and sees that she is in the grasp of a very large _(even by {{g.species}}_ _standards)_ and __very__ naked {{g.species}}
  > {{g.name}}
  >
  > mmm...~
  > you look _tasty_~
  - the {{g.species}} slowly opens her mouth
  > {{g.name}}
  >
  > try not to struggle too much, m'kay?~
  - {{b.name}} is unceremoniously dropped into the monster's mouth
  > {{g.name}}
  >
  > just as tasty as you look~\
  > _GULP_
  - {{b.name}} is sucked down the terrifying woman's throat, into her stomach
  - {{b.name}} has never been more scared in her life
  > {{g.name}}
  >
  > that's a good girl~
  >
  > thanks for not struggling~
  >
  > you were _sooo_ easy to eat~
  - {{b.name}} just sits in {{g.name}}'s stomach for nearly an hour, trying not to scream
  - for nearly _an hour_, {{b.name}} sits terrified in {{g.name}}'s stomach, as she walks somewhere, jostling the trembling girl in her stomach
  > {{b.name}}
  >
  > please...
  > let me out...
  >
  > _i don't want to die . . ._

  > {{g.name}}
  >
  > Hm?
  >
  > _hehe_, cute, tasty _and_ dumb?

  > {{b.name}}
  >
  > h-huh...?

  > {{g.name}}
  >
  > i'm not gonna _digest_ you, dummy~
  >
  > you're _way_ too cute to be a little meal~

  > {{b.name}}
  >
  > t-then... what do you want from me...?

  > {{g.name}}
  >
  > hehe, you'll see~
  
  > ***
  > __SPOILER__
  > ***
  > - {{g.name}} thinks {{b.name}} is cute and wants to keep her as a _girlfriend_
  > - for that to happen, though, {{g.name}} had to take her to a safe place, where she knew {{b.name}} couldn't get authorities involved before convincing her
notes: |
  - {{g.species}}es, and other large {{b.species}}oids, regurlarly eat {{b.species}}s alive, usually by swallowing them whole
  - {{g.species}}es, especially, are _very_ good at magic, almost as good as natural witches
