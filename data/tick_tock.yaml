  ### _MORNING_

  {{ g.name }} woke up bright and early, _actually_ __excited__ about asking {{ b.name }} out on a date.
  (she didn’t get much sleep, because she couldn’t stop herself from planning out the date she would take him on the next day)

  > Hey, {{ b.name }}-...
  >
  > _oh, no..._

  but, when {{ g.name }} woke up and looked at her belly, it was a little softer, a little rounder.
  {{ b.name }} _might've_ survived, sure.
  But {{ g.name }}'s hopes weren't high.

  __Nor were her spirits__

  > {{ b.name }}?
  >
  > H-Hey... {{ b.name }}...?
  > Buddy...?
  >
  > You still alive in there?
  >
  > Hello?
  >
  > ...Please...?
  >
  > fuck...
  >
  > I'm sorry, {{ b.name }}...
  > You would've made a pretty good boyfriend...
  > A _cute_ one too...
  >
  > __Stupid__ _metabolism_...

  > w-wha-?\
  > _cough_
  > _cough_
  > _wheeze_
  >
  > {{ g.nameFirst }}-{{ g.name }}?
  >
  > Am I...
  > D-Dead...?

  > {{ b.name }}!
  > You're okay!!
  >
  > __Perfect!__
  > ***
  > To make up for _almost_ digesting you,
  > I'm taking you on a date!
  >
  > You'll love this, I __Promise__!~

  {{ b.name }} was clearly too weak to move, but still alive.
  {{ g.name }} was going to have to get him out on her own -- not like she was ever going to _struggle_ with that.
