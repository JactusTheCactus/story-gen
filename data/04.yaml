girl:
  name: Dollie
  species: Pred
boy:
  name: Pierce
plot: |
  - {{g.name}} has a crush on {{b.name}}
  - she _knows_ he won't date her, knowing she's a Pred
  - Solution?
    1. Eat {{b.name}}
    1. Convince {{b.name}} that he'll be digested if he doesn't go out with her
    1. Get him to agree to a date
    1. Let him out of her stomach
    1. Go out with {{b.name}} on that date
    1. Earn his trust + affection
    1. __Profit!__
  - _Easier said than done_
    - {{g.name}} failed to account for the fact that {{b.name}} would think she wanted to __kill__ him.
notes: |
  - {{g.name}} is a smokeshow
  - {{b.name}} doesn't want to date {{g.name}} for the same reason any other human wouldn't be anywhere near a Pred;
    - Preds are __terrifying__
    - They _eat people_
      - Swallow them whole
      - Fully digested their Prey in > 1 hour
      - They feel no sympathy for past, present or future Prey
        - Some Preds get _joy_ from the suffering of their Prey
