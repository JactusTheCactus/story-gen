> You know what?
>
> You're actually pretty cute,
so I'll make you a deal;\
if you're still alive and undigested by morning,
I'll let you out.
>
> If not?
Well...
You get to be my breakfast!\~

### _MORNING_

Vera woke up bright and early, _actually _excited__ about asking Eli out on a date.
(She didn’t get much sleep, because she couldn’t stop herself from planning out the date she would take him on the next day)

> Hey, Eli-...
>
> _Oh, no..._

But, when Vera looked at her belly, it was a little softer, a little rounder.
Eli _might've_ survived, sure.
But Vera's hopes weren't high.

__Nor were her spirits__

> Eli?
>
> H-Hey... Eli...?
Buddy...?
>
> You still alive in there?
>
> Hello?
>
> ...Please...?
>
> Fuck...
>
> I'm sorry, Eli...
You would've made a pretty good boyfriend...
A _cute_ one too...
>
> __Stupid_ metabolism_...

> W-wha-?\
_Cough_
_Cough_
_Wheeze_
>
> V-Vera?
>
> Am I...
D-Dead...?

> Eli!
You're okay!!
>
> __Perfect!__
> ***
> To make up for _almost_ digesting you,
I'm taking you on a date!
>
> You'll love this, I __Promise__!\~

Eli was clearly too weak to move, but still alive.
Vera was going to have to get him out on her own &mdash; not like she was ever going to _struggle_ with that.
