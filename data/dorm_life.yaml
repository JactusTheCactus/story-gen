  - {{ g.name }} moves into a __College Dorm__
    - All her {{ b.name }} are _Female_
      - And _very_ __Hot__
        - curvy in all the right ways
    - by the end of __Week 1__, {{ g.name }} has realized that __All 5 Of Her {{ b.name }} Are {{ b.species }}s__
      - {{ b.species }}s:
        - identical to {{ g.species }}s
        - eat a diet of exclusivley {{ g.species }}s
          - swallow {{ g.species }}s whole
            - no chewing
            - full digestion, to a flat / empty tummy, in 1 hour
      - there are rules against {{ b.species }}s eating their {{ b.name }}, so {{ g.name }} is _safe_
        - however, the punishment for eating {{ b.name }} is __A Light Warning__ + a _$10 Fine_
          - due to a concerning amount of {{ b.species }}s in politics, __Vore__ is not legally __Homicide__ or __Cannibalism__
        - there are __no such rules__ for the people in _other dorm rooms_
      - Plus, {{ g.name }}'s {{ b.name }} seem to _like_ her, so she doesn't think they'd eat her anyways
