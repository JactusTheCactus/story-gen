plot: |
  - {{ b.name }} has somehow found himself at a party held by __The Royal Family__
  - obviously, he's been keeping his distance from the _important_ people;
    - barons, baronesses, dukes, duchess, etc.
    - _especially_ the __Royals__
  - {{ b.name }} has, however, made a friend at this party, by the name of {{ g.name }}
  - She's a beautiful girl, and a lovely dancer
notes: |
  - {{ g.name }}'s _mother_ is the __Queen of the Kingdom__
  - {{ b.name }} is low-middle class
  - {{ g.name }} is kept from the public eye, hence why {{ b.name }} didn't recognize her as __The Princess__
