****************
Characters
----------
- DOLLIE
    - PRED
- PIERCE
    - HUMAN

Plot
----
- Dollie has a crush on Pierce
- She _knows_ he won't date her, knowing she's a Pred
- Solution?
    1. Eat Pierce
    1. Convince Pierce that he'll be digested if he doesn't go out with her
    1. Get him to agree to a date
    1. Let him out of her stomach
    1. Go out with Pierce on that date
    1. Earn his trust + affection
    1. __Profit!__
- _Easier said than done_
    - Dollie failed to account for the fact that Pierce would think she wanted to __kill__ him.

Notes
-----
- Dollie is a smokeshow
- Pierce doesn't want to date Dollie for the same reason any other human wouldn't be anywhere near a Pred;
    - Preds are __terrifying__
    - They _eat people_
        - Swallow them whole
        - Fully digested their Prey in > 1 hour
        - They feel no sympathy for past, present or future Prey
            - Some Preds get _joy_ from the suffering of their Prey
                - Dollie included
    - She has a history of digesting her boyfriends
        - Dollie seems to _relish_ in her Prey's fear as they're digested
