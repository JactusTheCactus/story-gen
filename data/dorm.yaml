          - swallow ${girl.species}s whole

            - full digestion, to a flat / empty tummy, in 1 hour
      - there are rules against ${boy.species}s eating their ${boy.name}, so ${girl.name} is _safe_
        - however, the punishment for eating ${boy.name} is __A Light Warning__ + a _$10 Fine_
          - due to a concerning amount of ${boy.species}s in politics, __Vore__ is not legally __Homicide__ or __Cannibalism__

      - Plus, ${girl.name}'s ${boy.name} seem to _like_ her, so she doesn't think they'd eat her anyways
