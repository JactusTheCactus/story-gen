Write Me A Story
****************
"Power"
=======

Characters
----------
- Lia
	- Human

Plot
----
- Lia is the Human bard of an adventuring party
- She always avoids fighting
	- Her party assumes this is because she is scared of getting hurt
		- The _real_ reason is that Lia is worried about collateral damage
			- Ã€ la the __Pistol Shrimp__ scene of "Project Power"
- When Lia uses her power:
	- Eyes turn gold
		- The _metal_,
			not the _colour_
	- Sinks several inches into the ground,
		due to her _exponentiated mass_
	- Speed almost looks like teleportation
		- Each step causes a _thundercrack_

Notes
-----
- Shortly prior to the start of the story,
	the party entered a defiled church
	- Lia seemed reluctant to enter
		- _odd_
	- Due to it being a _defiled_ church,
		Lia felt safe entering
		- __very odd__
- This is a known ability in this world
	- It is of _deific_ rarity
