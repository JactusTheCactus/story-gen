### _MORNING_
Vera woke up bright and early, _actually_ __excited__ about asking Eli out on a date.
(she didn’t get much sleep, because she couldn’t stop herself from planning out the date she would take him on the next day)

but, when Vera woke up and looked at her belly, it was a little softer, a little rounder.
Eli _might've_ survived, sure.
But Vera's hopes weren't high.

__Nor were her spirits__

> I can't exactly date _buttfat_~

Eli was clearly too weak to move, but still alive.
Vera was going to have to get him out on her own &mdash; not like she was ever going to _struggle_ with that.
