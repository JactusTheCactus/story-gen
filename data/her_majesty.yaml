plot: |
  - {{ b.name }} has somehow found himself at a party held by __The Royal Family__
  - obviously, he's been keeping his distance from the _important_ people;
    - barons, baronesses, dukes, duchess, etc.
    - _especially_ the __Royals__ (__Big__ _No-No_)
  - {{ b.name }} has, however, made a friend at this party, by the name of {{ g.name }}
  - She's a _small_, _beautiful_ girl, and a _lovely_ dancer
  - better yet, she seems completely enamoured with him
  ### Later That Night
  - {{ g.name }} gets _too comfortable_ with {{ b.name }} and accidentally hints at who she _really_ is; __The Princess__
  - she can tell by his expression _(and the noise he made)_ that he's going to run
    - she has a bad track record for having her boyfriends __not__ get eaten by her or her mother (it's an almost even split between the two, though {{ g.name }} does currently have the lead)
notes: |
  - {{ g.name }}'s _mother_ is the __Queen of the Kingdom__
    - __The Queen__ is a very dangerous and vengeful Pred _(public information)_
      - most of {{ g.name }}'s potential suitors have been a meal for __The Queen__
  - {{ b.name }} is low-middle class
  - {{ g.name }} is kept from the public eye, hence why {{ b.name }} didn't recognize her as __The Princess__
