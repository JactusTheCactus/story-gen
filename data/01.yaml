  - {{g.nameList[0]}} eats {{g.nameList[1]}}
  - {{g.nameList[0]}} doesn't know who {{g.nameList[1]}} is
    > Let me OUT!

    > Why would I do that,
    hmm?~
    >
    > You're just a __Meal__~
    >
    > Now _shut up_ and __Digest__~

    *{{g.nameList[1]}} realizes {{g.nameList[0]}} isn't gonna let her out*
    > U-uhh, w-when {{b.name}} finds out about this, he'll... h-he'll, uhmm...
    >
    > _oh, f-fuck..._

    > Why would _{{b.name}}_ help you?

    > Because he's... my _brother_...
    >
    > Please let me out...
    >
    > {{b.name}}'ll miss me...

    > You're {{b.name}}'s __sister__??
  - {{g.nameList[0]}} panics and lets {{g.nameList[1]}} out
    > _Please_, don't let {{b.name}} find out,
    I'm _begging_ you...
    >
    > I'll do _anything_,
    just please don't tell him that I ate you...

    > W-why would I do that...?
    
    *{{g.nameList[0]}} glares threateningly*

    > _Eep!_
    >
    > S-sorry, I won't tell him!
    >
    > _Please_, don't eat me again...!
  ***
  - not long after,
    {{g.nameList[0]}} goes to ask {{b.name}} on a date
    > H-hey, {{b.name}}...
    >
    > You, uhh... You busy tonight?
    >
    > I was thinking,
    maybe...
    you might want to see a movie with me tonight...?

    > Didn't you _eat {{g.nameList[1]}}_?

    *{{g.nameList[0]}}'s smile disappeared completely, replaced by fear*

    > I-I, uhh, I...
    >
    > . . .
    >
    > h-how do you know about that...?
    
    *{{g.nameList[0]}} is internally __(and a little externally)__ panicking, terrified that her chances with {{b.name}} are ruined*

    *{{b.name}} turns to leave, but {{g.nameList[0]}} grabs his arm*

    > _PLEASE_, don't go!
    >
    > I-I promise to make it up to you... s-somehow...
    >
    > Just... please, see that movie with me...?

  - {{g.nameList[0]}} has a _huge_ crush on {{b.name}}
    - eating {{b.name}}'s sister is __not__ going to help her chances with him
